When I was young, my dad showed me some basic HTML, and I loved it. When I was 15 I started learning some PHP, CSS and JS and I loved it even more. I knew it's gonna change my life and be my best hobby. I started doing some hobby projects and practicing basics of webdev. Besides beautiful pages I started making some bots and scripts for myself. I used Node.js to make them faster and better. Few years later I started doing some serious projects using Laravel for backend and then switched to Angular. That was very good idea, because I started working on commercial projects and I think I love it. The feeling that my code is used every day is something that I always wanted.
